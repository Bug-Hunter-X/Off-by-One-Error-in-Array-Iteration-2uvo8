# Off-by-One Error in Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The bug arises from an incorrect loop condition that leads to accessing an element outside the array's bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version with the proper loop condition to avoid the error.

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop boundaries when working with arrays or other data structures in Java.
